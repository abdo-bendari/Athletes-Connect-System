## Features
- **AI-Powered Match Prediction with Synaptic**
One of the key features of Athletes-Connect-System is the integration of **Synaptic**, a **neural network library**, to predict match outcomes. The process starts by training a model using historical team statistics. This is done by running the command `ts-node src/utils/trainModel.ts`, which processes and refines the data. Once the model is trained, it can be used in a practical function that takes real-time user input (team statistics) and predicts the likely winner of an upcoming match. This AI-driven prediction system empowers users to make data-backed decisions, enhancing their sports experience with intelligent insights.
 - **GeoJSON for Location-Based Stadium Recommendations**
Another core feature is the use of **GeoJSON** technology to help users **find the nearest stadium to their location**. By retrieving the user's geographical coordinates, the system uses GeoJSON to calculate the closest stadium and return the relevant details. This feature ensures that athletes can easily locate and navigate to the nearest sporting events, providing a seamless and convenient experience based on real-time location data.
