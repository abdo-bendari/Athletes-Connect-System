# About


**Athletes-Connect-System** is a sophisticated platform developed to bridge the gap between athletes, teams, and sports events, offering a seamless and intuitive experience for all users. It enables athletes to discover, participate, and engage in various sporting events effortlessly, while also facilitating team management and stadium bookings. By connecting athletes and sports enthusiasts from different backgrounds, the system fosters a thriving sports community, allowing users to share experiences, collaborate, and improve their skills together.
The platform offers a comprehensive set of features designed to meet the diverse needs of athletes and sports organizers. Athletes can easily sign up, create profiles, join teams, and book stadiums for events. Event organizers can create and manage sports events, including scheduling matches, assigning teams, and tracking event progress. The inclusion of a Review model allows participants to leave feedback on events, teams, and matches, which helps improve future experiences and enhances the sense of community.

In addition to these features, Athletes-Connect-System integrates advanced technologies to ensure high performance and provide innovative functionalities. **GeoJSON** technology is employed to allow for precise geographic location tracking. This ensures that users can easily find and participate in events and **locate nearby stadiums** based on their current position.
A standout feature of the platform is its integration of **Synaptic**, a powerful neural network library that uses **artificial intelligence( AI )** to **predict match outcomes**. A specially developed function analyzes various team statistics, including past performances, player data, and historical match results, to provide accurate predictions of the likely winner. This predictive functionality empowers users to make more informed decisions, stay engaged with ongoing events, and follow their favorite teams more closely.

With Athletes-Connect-System, the goal is to create a hub where athletes and sports fans can easily navigate the world of sports events. The platform not only offers practical tools for participation and event management but also enhances the user experience through AI-powered features and real-time location-based services, making it a unique solution for both amateur and professional athletes
## Features
- **AI-Powered Match Prediction with Synaptic**
One of the key features of Athletes-Connect-System is the integration of **Synaptic**, a **neural network library**, to predict match outcomes. The process starts by training a model using historical team statistics. This is done by running the command `ts-node src/utils/trainModel.ts`, which processes and refines the data. Once the model is trained, it can be used in a practical function that takes real-time user input (team statistics) and predicts the likely winner of an upcoming match. This AI-driven prediction system empowers users to make data-backed decisions, enhancing their sports experience with intelligent insights.
 - **GeoJSON for Location-Based Stadium Recommendations**
Another core feature is the use of **GeoJSON** technology to help users **find the nearest stadium to their location**. By retrieving the user's geographical coordinates, the system uses GeoJSON to calculate the closest stadium and return the relevant details. This feature ensures that athletes can easily locate and navigate to the nearest sporting events, providing a seamless and convenient experience based on real-time location data.
- **User Authentication**
A secure and streamlined sign-in and sign-up process enables athletes to easily join the community, with a personalized experience for managing events, bookings, and teams.
Booking Management
Users can create, update, cancel, and track their bookings while filtering by payment or status and checking stadium availability for events.
- **Stadium Management**
Stadiums can be added, updated, searched, and reserved, with a feature to find nearby stadiums based on location and sport type.
- **Booking Management**
Users can create, update, cancel, and track bookings, along with checking availability and filtering by payment or status.
- **Event Management**
Organizers can easily create, update, delete events, and distribute teams for tournaments, simplifying event coordination.
- **Match Management**
This feature allows for scheduling and managing matches, retrieving match results, and predicting winners based on team statistics using AI.
- **Review System**
Users can leave, view, and delete reviews for events, teams, and stadiums, with quick access to the most recent reviews.
- **Team Management**
Athletes can manage teams by creating, updating, and deleting teams, adding/removing players, changing captains, and tracking match results.
- **Tournament Management**
Organizers can create, update, and delete tournaments, view tournament details, set winners, and manage tournament status with ease.

## Using

The platform is built with the following technologies:

<ul> <li><strong>bcrypt</strong>: A library for securely hashing user passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring the protection of user data.</li> <li><strong>CORS</strong>: Middleware for enabling secure cross-origin requests between the client and the backend API, ensuring proper security during communication.</li> <li><strong>dotenv</strong>: Loads environment variables from a .env file, ensuring sensitive information like API keys and database credentials remain secure.</li> <li><strong>Express.js</strong>: A lightweight web framework for building RESTful APIs and managing HTTP requests and responses, helping to structure the application.</li> <li><strong>jsonwebtoken (JWT)</strong>: Used for securing user authentication and ensuring that only authorized users can access protected routes and services.</li> <li><strong>mongoose</strong>: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose simplifies database interactions by defining schemas and models and offering powerful query capabilities.</li> <li><strong>morgan</strong>: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js, used to log request details, helping with debugging and monitoring.</li> <li><strong>nodemon</strong>: A development tool that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected, improving the development workflow.</li> <li><strong>rimraf</strong>: A tool for deleting files and directories, particularly used for cleaning up the project during the build process.</li> <li><strong>synaptic</strong>: A neural network library used to power the AI-driven match prediction feature, utilizing team statistics to predict match outcomes.</li> </ul>
